        <h2>The beginning of the story...</h2>
        <p>
          Oquirrh Mountain Art was born out of a young boy's love and
          appreciation of nature and its beauty. This love was nutured over time
          and began to manifest itself in the drawings of Brett as a young
          artist. His ability to capture the beauty of the world around him grew
          as he did. The mediums that the artwork came in grew with time. He now
          has an extensive portfolio of artwork that is just waiting to grace
          your living spaces with its serenity...
